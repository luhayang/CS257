There's some errors happening when I run the program on safari. 
Some functions from mainjs.js are not working (line 1~24: onclick, onmouseenter, function changeColor()).
But since it's working on jsfiddle, I'm attaching jsfiddle link that contains mainpage.html, mainjs.js, maincss.css 
  (execept for the part that links to hompage.html).
